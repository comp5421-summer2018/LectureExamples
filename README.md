# COMP 5421 Lecture Examples
This repository contains code examples during lectures for COMP 5421 (Advanced C++ Programming) at Concordia University (Montreal, QC, CA).

Examples were recorded using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) and use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project although the code should be compatible into any IDE.
